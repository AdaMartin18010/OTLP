## 3. Formal Verification Framework

This section presents our comprehensive formal verification framework for OTLP.
 We describe the mathematical foundations, verification techniques,
 and how they work together to ensure correctness and consistency of OTLP-based distributed tracing systems.

### 3.1 Framework Overview

Our verification framework consists of five interconnected components, each addressing specific aspects of OTLP correctness:

**Architecture**:

```text

│  • Diagnostic Reports    • Property Guarantees              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each component operates at a different abstraction level:

1. **Type System** (Section 3.2): Ensures that OTLP data structures are well-formed and type-correct.
  Detects violations like invalid trace IDs, missing required fields, or type mismatches.

2. **Algebraic Structures** (Section 3.4): Models data composition and aggregation using monoids, lattices, and category theory. Ensures that combining spans or traces preserves essential properties.

3. **Triple Flow Analysis** (Section 3.3): Tracks control flow (call hierarchy), data flow (context propagation), and execution flow (temporal ordering). Detects causality violations and context loss.

4. **Temporal Logic** (Section 3.5): Specifies and verifies system-wide properties using LTL and CTL. Examples include "all spans eventually complete" or "errors are always logged."

5. **Semantic Validation**: Checks compliance with OTLP semantic conventions (e.g., attribute naming, value constraints).

These components are not independent—they interact and reinforce each other. For example, the type system provides input to flow analysis, which in turn informs temporal logic verification.

**Design Principles**:

- **Composability**: Each component can be used independently or combined for comprehensive verification.
- **Incrementality**: Verification can be performed on partial traces or streaming data, not just complete traces.
- **Practicality**: The framework is designed for real-world deployment, balancing rigor with performance.
- **Extensibility**: New verification rules or properties can be added without redesigning the framework.

### 3.2 Type System

Our type system ensures structural correctness of OTLP data. We use a combination of dependent types, refinement types, and type soundness proofs.

#### 3.2.1 Core Type Definitions

**Trace Context Types**:

```text
TraceID    = Bytes[16]              -- 16-byte array
SpanID     = Bytes[8]               -- 8-byte array
TraceFlags = Bits[8]                -- 8-bit flags

SpanContext = {
  trace_id:    TraceID,
  span_id:     SpanID,
  trace_flags: TraceFlags,
  trace_state: String[<512]         -- W3C Trace State
}
```

**Span Types with Refinements**:

```text
Timestamp = {t: Int64 | t ≥ 0}      -- Non-negative Unix nanoseconds

Span = {
  context:       SpanContext,
  parent_id:     Option[SpanID],
  name:          {s: String | 1 ≤ len(s) ≤ 256},
  kind:          SpanKind,
  start_time:    Timestamp,
  end_time:      {t: Timestamp | t ≥ start_time},  -- Dependent type
  attributes:    Map[String, AttributeValue],
  events:        List[Event],
  links:         List[Link],
  status:        Status
}

where
  SpanKind ∈ {INTERNAL, SERVER, CLIENT, PRODUCER, CONSUMER}
  
  AttributeValue = Int64 | Float64 | String | Bool | Array[Int64] | ...
  
  Event = {
    time:       Timestamp,
    name:       String,
    attributes: Map[String, AttributeValue]
  }
  
  Link = {
    context:    SpanContext,
    attributes: Map[String, AttributeValue]
  }
  
  Status = {
    code: {UNSET, OK, ERROR},
    message: Option[String]
  }
```

**Key Properties**:

1. **Non-negative Timestamps**: `Timestamp = {t: Int64 | t ≥ 0}` prevents invalid negative timestamps.

2. **Causality Constraint**: `end_time: {t: Timestamp | t ≥ start_time}` ensures spans don't end before they start.

3. **Bounded Strings**: Span names are 1-256 characters, preventing empty or excessively long names.

4. **Type-safe IDs**: TraceID and SpanID are distinct types (not just byte arrays), preventing accidental misuse.

#### 3.2.2 Dependent Types for Parent-Child Relationships

A critical correctness property is that every span (except root spans) must have a valid parent. We encode this using dependent types:

```text
TraceStore = Map[TraceID, Set[Span]]

ValidSpan[store: TraceStore] = {
  s: Span |
    (s.parent_id = None) ∨                    -- Root span, or
    (∃ parent ∈ store[s.context.trace_id].    -- Parent exists
       parent.context.span_id = s.parent_id ∧
       parent.start_time ≤ s.start_time ∧     -- Parent starts before child
       parent.end_time ≥ s.start_time)        -- Parent active when child starts
}
```

This dependent type ensures that:

- Root spans have no parent (`parent_id = None`)
- Non-root spans have a parent in the same trace
- The parent starts before or when the child starts
- The parent is still active when the child starts (allowing for asynchronous spawning)

**Type Checking Algorithm**:

```text
function typecheck_span(s: Span, store: TraceStore) → Result[Unit, TypeError]:
  // 1. Check basic structure
  if len(s.context.trace_id) ≠ 16:
    return Error("Invalid TraceID length")
  
  if len(s.context.span_id) ≠ 8:
    return Error("Invalid SpanID length")
  
  if s.end_time < s.start_time:
    return Error("Span ends before it starts")
  
  // 2. Check parent relationship
  if s.parent_id is Some(pid):
    let trace_spans = store.get(s.context.trace_id)
    let parent = trace_spans.find(λ p. p.context.span_id = pid)
    
    if parent is None:
      return Error("Parent span not found")
    
    if parent.start_time > s.start_time:
      return Error("Parent starts after child")
    
    if parent.end_time < s.start_time:
      return Error("Parent ended before child started")
  
  // 3. Check semantic attributes
  for (key, value) in s.attributes:
    if not validate_attribute(key, value):
      return Error(f"Invalid attribute {key}: {value}")
  
  return Ok(())
```

**Soundness Theorem**:

**Theorem 1 (Type Soundness)**:  
If a span `s` is well-typed under our type system (`⊢ s : ValidSpan[store]`), then:

1. All structural invariants hold (IDs have correct length, timestamps are valid)
2. If `s` is not a root span, its parent exists and satisfies causality constraints
3. All attributes conform to their expected types

*Proof*: By induction on the structure of the type checking algorithm. See `academic/OTLP_Formal_Proofs_Complete.md` for the full proof.

**Example Application to Running Example**:

Recall Span 3 from our e-commerce example:

```text
Span 3: product-service.get_product
  TraceID: abc123, SpanID: 003, ParentID: 002
  Start: T+20ms, End: T+80ms
```

Type checking:

1. ✅ TraceID "abc123" → Valid (assuming 16-byte encoding)
2. ✅ SpanID "003" → Valid (8-byte)
3. ✅ End time (T+80) ≥ Start time (T+20)
4. ✅ Parent Span 002 exists with Start: T+10ms, End: T+110ms
5. ✅ Parent starts (T+10) before child (T+20)
6. ✅ Parent active (T+10 to T+110) when child starts (T+20)

If there was a clock drift violation where Span 3 recorded Start: T+5ms (before its parent Span 2 starts at T+10ms), the type checker would reject it:

```text
Error: "Parent starts after child" (Span 002 at T+10, Span 003 at T+5)
```

---

### 3.3 Triple Flow Analysis

Triple flow analysis tracks three types of flows through distributed tracing systems: control flow, data flow, and execution flow. Together, they ensure causality preservation and context propagation correctness.

#### 3.3.1 Control Flow Analysis (CFA)

Control flow analysis constructs the call graph of spans, representing which operations invoke which others.

**Call Graph Definition**:

```text
CallGraph = (V, E)
where
  V = Set[Span]                     -- Vertices: all spans
  E = {(p, c) | c.parent_id = Some(p.context.span_id)}  -- Edges: parent-child
```

**Properties to Verify**:

1. **Acyclicity**: The call graph must be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A cycle would indicate a logical impossibility (an operation calling itself via a chain of calls).

2. **Connectedness**: Within a trace, all spans should be reachable from the root span. Disconnected components indicate context propagation failures.

3. **Span Kind Consistency**: Parent-child relationships should respect span kinds. For example, a `CLIENT` span should typically have a corresponding `SERVER` span as a child (in the called service).

**CFA Algorithm**:

```text
function control_flow_analysis(trace: List[Span]) → Result[CallGraph, CFAError]:
  let G = build_call_graph(trace)
  
  // Check acyclicity
  if has_cycle(G):
    return Error("Cycle detected in call graph")
  
  // Check connectedness
  let roots = {s ∈ trace | s.parent_id = None}
  if len(roots) > 1:
    return Error("Multiple root spans in a single trace")
  
  let reachable = dfs(G, roots[0])
  if len(reachable) < len(trace):
    let orphans = trace \ reachable
    return Error(f"Orphaned spans detected: {orphans}")
  
  // Check span kind consistency
  for (parent, child) in G.edges:
    if not consistent_span_kinds(parent.kind, child.kind):
      return Error(f"Inconsistent span kinds: {parent.kind} → {child.kind}")
  
  return Ok(G)
```

**Example**: In our e-commerce example, the call graph is:

```text
Span 1 (frontend, SERVER)
  └─ Span 2 (api-gateway, SERVER)
      ├─ Span 3 (product-service, SERVER)
      │   └─ Span 4 (database, CLIENT)
      └─ Span 5 (inventory-service, SERVER)
          └─ Span 6 (cache, CLIENT)
```

This graph is acyclic, connected, and has consistent span kinds (CLIENT spans are leaves, SERVER spans have children).

If Span 5 had a different Trace ID due to context loss, CFA would detect:

```text
Error: "Orphaned spans detected: [Span 5, Span 6]"
```

#### 3.3.2 Data Flow Analysis (DFA)

Data flow analysis tracks how trace context propagates across service boundaries.

**Trace Context Propagation**:

In distributed systems, trace context is transmitted via:

- HTTP headers (`traceparent`, `tracestate`)
- gRPC metadata
- Message queue attributes (e.g., Kafka headers)

**DFA Abstraction**:

```text
ContextFlow = (S, F)
where
  S = Set[Service]                  -- Services in the system
  F = {(s1, s2, ctx) | service s1 sends context ctx to service s2}
```

**Properties to Verify**:

1. **Context Preservation**: When a service calls another, the trace context must be propagated.

2. **Context Consistency**: The trace ID must remain constant within a trace; span IDs must be unique.

3. **No Context Corruption**: Context values must not be modified or truncated during propagation.

**DFA Algorithm**:

```text
function data_flow_analysis(trace: List[Span]) → Result[Unit, DFAError]:
  let trace_id = trace[0].context.trace_id
  
  // Check trace ID consistency
  for s in trace:
    if s.context.trace_id ≠ trace_id:
      return Error(f"Span {s.context.span_id} has wrong trace ID")
  
  // Check span ID uniqueness
  let span_ids = {s.context.span_id | s ∈ trace}
  if len(span_ids) < len(trace):
    return Error("Duplicate span IDs detected")
  
  // Check context propagation at service boundaries
  for (parent, child) in get_cross_service_calls(trace):
    if parent.context.trace_id ≠ child.context.trace_id:
      return Error(f"Context not propagated from {parent} to {child}")
    
    // Check that parent span ID is set as child's parent
    if child.parent_id ≠ Some(parent.context.span_id):
      return Error(f"Parent-child relationship broken at service boundary")
  
  return Ok(())
```

**Example**: When `api-gateway` (Span 2) calls `product-service` (Span 3):

```text
api-gateway sends HTTP request with headers:
  traceparent: 00-abc123-002-01
  (version-trace_id-span_id-flags)

product-service receives and creates Span 3:
  context.trace_id:  abc123  ✅ (same)
  context.span_id:   003     ✅ (new)
  parent_id:         002     ✅ (api-gateway's span)
```

If `api-gateway` failed to set the `traceparent` header, `product-service` would generate a new trace ID, and DFA would detect:

```text
Error: "Context not propagated from Span 002 to Span 003"
```

#### 3.3.3 Execution Flow Analysis

Execution flow analysis tracks the temporal ordering of events, ensuring that causality is preserved even in the presence of clock drift, asynchronous operations, and out-of-order arrival.

**Happens-Before Relation**:

We define a happens-before relation `→` based on Lamport clocks and span relationships:

```text
s1 → s2  ⟺  (s1 is an ancestor of s2 in the call graph) ∧
             (s1.start_time ≤ s2.start_time)
```

**Causality Invariant**:

For any two spans `s1` and `s2` in the same trace:

```text
If s1 → s2 (s1 happens before s2), then s1.start_time ≤ s2.start_time
```

**Clock Drift Tolerance**:

In practice, we allow a tolerance `δ` (e.g., 50ms) to account for clock drift:

```text
If s1 → s2, then s1.start_time ≤ s2.start_time + δ
```

If this is violated, we flag it as a potential causality violation but distinguish it from logical errors.

**Execution Flow Algorithm**:

```text
function execution_flow_analysis(trace: List[Span], δ: Duration) → Result[Unit, EFAError]:
  let G = build_call_graph(trace)
  
  for (parent, child) in G.edges:
    // Check basic causality
    if parent.start_time > child.start_time + δ:
      return Error(f"Causality violation: parent {parent.context.span_id} " +
                   f"starts after child {child.context.span_id}")
    
    // Check that child starts before parent ends (allowing async)
    if child.start_time > parent.end_time + δ:
      return Warning(f"Child {child.context.span_id} starts after " +
                     f"parent {parent.context.span_id} ends (async operation)")
  
  // Check for overlapping siblings (concurrent operations)
  for (s1, s2) in get_siblings(G):
    if overlaps(s1, s2):
      // This is fine for concurrent operations, just log
      log(f"Concurrent spans: {s1.context.span_id} and {s2.context.span_id}")
  
  return Ok(())
```

**Example**: In our e-commerce example, Span 5 (inventory-service) starts at T+85ms, while its parent Span 2 (api-gateway) started at T+10ms:

```text
T+10 ≤ T+85 + δ  →  True ✅
```

If Span 5 recorded Start: T+5ms due to a 5ms fast clock:

```text
T+10 ≤ T+5 + 50ms  →  T+10 ≤ T+55  →  True ✅ (within tolerance)
```

But if the drift was 10ms:

```text
T+10 ≤ T+0 + 50ms  →  True, but if δ=5ms:
T+10 ≤ T+0 + 5ms   →  False ❌
Error: "Causality violation: parent 002 starts after child 005"
```

**Theorem 2 (Causality Preservation)**:  
If a trace passes execution flow analysis with tolerance `δ`, then for any two spans `s1` and `s2` where `s1` is an ancestor of `s2`, we have:

```text
s1.start_time ≤ s2.start_time + δ
```

### 3.4 Algebraic Structures

Algebraic structures provide a mathematical framework for reasoning about composition and aggregation of telemetry data. We use monoids for span composition, lattices for trace aggregation, and category theory for interoperability.

#### 3.4.1 Monoid Structure for Span Composition

**Definition**: A monoid is a set `M` with a binary operation `⊕: M × M → M` and an identity element `e ∈ M` such that:

1. **Associativity**: `(a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)` for all `a, b, c ∈ M`
2. **Identity**: `e ⊕ a = a ⊕ e = a` for all `a ∈ M`

**Span Composition Monoid**:

We define a monoid `(Span*, ⊕, ε)` where:

- `Span*` = partial spans (spans with possibly incomplete information)
- `⊕` = attribute merging operation
- `ε` = empty span (identity)

**Attribute Merging Operation**:

```text
s1 ⊕ s2 = Span {
  context:    s1.context,                 -- Keep first span's context
  parent_id:  s1.parent_id,
  name:       s1.name,
  kind:       s1.kind,
  start_time: min(s1.start_time, s2.start_time),  -- Earliest start
  end_time:   max(s1.end_time, s2.end_time),      -- Latest end
  attributes: merge_attributes(s1.attributes, s2.attributes),
  events:     s1.events ++ s2.events,     -- Concatenate events
  links:      s1.links ∪ s2.links,        -- Union of links
  status:     merge_status(s1.status, s2.status)
}

where merge_attributes(a1, a2) =
  a1 ∪ a2  (with a2 overriding a1 on conflicts)
```

**Why Monoid Properties Matter**:

1. **Associativity** means we can compose spans in any order:

   ```text
   (s1 ⊕ s2) ⊕ s3 = s1 ⊕ (s2 ⊕ s3)
   ```

   This is crucial for distributed systems where spans may arrive out of order.

2. **Identity** means an empty span doesn't change composition:

   ```text
   s ⊕ ε = ε ⊕ s = s
   ```

   This simplifies handling of optional or missing spans.

**Theorem 3 (Span Composition Associativity)**:  
The span composition operation `⊕` is associative: for any spans `s1, s2, s3`,

```text
(s1 ⊕ s2) ⊕ s3 = s1 ⊕ (s2 ⊕ s3)
```

*Proof*: By structural induction, showing that each field of the composed span is equal on both sides. Attribute merging inherits associativity from map union.

**Practical Application**: When collecting spans from multiple sources (e.g., different SDKs or collectors), we can merge them in any order and get the same result. This enables parallelizable span processing.

#### 3.4.2 Lattice Structure for Trace Aggregation

**Definition**: A lattice is a partially ordered set `(L, ≤)` where every two elements `a, b ∈ L` have:

1. **Join** (least upper bound): `a ⊔ b`
2. **Meet** (greatest lower bound): `a ⊓ b`

**Trace Aggregation Lattice**:

We define a lattice `(TraceViews, ⊑)` where:

- `TraceViews` = different views or projections of a trace (e.g., spans from different services, sampled traces)
- `v1 ⊑ v2` means `v1` is a subset of `v2` (less information)
- `v1 ⊔ v2` = union of views (merge information)
- `v1 ⊓ v2` = intersection of views (common information)

**Example**: Consider three trace views:

```text
v1 = {Span 1, Span 2}           (frontend and api-gateway)
v2 = {Span 2, Span 3, Span 4}   (api-gateway and product-service)
v3 = {Span 2, Span 5, Span 6}   (api-gateway and inventory-service)

v1 ⊔ v2 = {Span 1, 2, 3, 4}     (merge v1 and v2)
v1 ⊔ v2 ⊔ v3 = {Span 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}  (complete trace)

v1 ⊓ v2 = {Span 2}              (common span)
v1 ⊓ v3 = {Span 2}
v2 ⊓ v3 = {Span 2}
```

**Properties**:

1. **Idempotence**: `v ⊔ v = v` (merging a view with itself gives the same view)
2. **Commutativity**: `v1 ⊔ v2 = v2 ⊔ v1` (order doesn't matter)
3. **Associativity**: `(v1 ⊔ v2) ⊔ v3 = v1 ⊔ (v2 ⊔ v3)`

**Theorem 4 (Trace Aggregation Lattice)**:  
The structure `(TraceViews, ⊑, ⊔, ⊓)` forms a lattice, where:

- `⊑` is the subset relation
- `⊔` is set union
- `⊓` is set intersection

*Proof*: Standard result from set theory; subset relation with union and intersection forms a lattice.

**Practical Application**: When aggregating traces from multiple collectors or during sampling, the lattice structure ensures that we can combine partial views consistently, and that the "complete" trace is the least upper bound of all partial views.

#### 3.4.3 Category Theory for Interoperability

**Definition**: A category `C` consists of:

1. Objects `Ob(C)`
2. Morphisms `Hom(A, B)` for each pair of objects `A, B`
3. Composition operation `∘`
4. Identity morphisms `id_A` for each object `A`

**OTLP Interoperability Category**:

We model different OTLP implementations (SDKs, collectors, backends) as a category:

- **Objects**: Data models (e.g., Java SDK span, Go SDK span, OTLP Protobuf span)
- **Morphisms**: Transformations between models (e.g., serialization, deserialization, format conversion)
- **Composition**: Chaining transformations (e.g., Java SDK → Protobuf → Backend storage format)

**Example**:

```text
Objects:
  - JavaSpan (Java SDK's internal representation)
  - OTLPSpan (OTLP Protobuf message)
  - JaegerSpan (Jaeger backend format)

Morphisms:
  - serialize: JavaSpan → OTLPSpan
  - convert: OTLPSpan → JaegerSpan
  - store: JaegerSpan → Database

Composition:
  store ∘ convert ∘ serialize: JavaSpan → Database
```

**Functors for Property Preservation**:

A functor `F: C → D` maps objects and morphisms from category `C` to category `D` while preserving structure. We use functors to ensure that transformations preserve essential span properties.

**Property-Preserving Functor**:

```text
F: OTLPCategory → PropertyCategory

F(JavaSpan) = Properties(JavaSpan)
F(OTLPSpan) = Properties(OTLPSpan)

F(serialize) preserves properties:
  If p ∈ Properties(JavaSpan), then p ∈ Properties(F(serialize)(JavaSpan))
```

**Example Properties to Preserve**:

- Trace ID and span ID
- Parent-child relationships
- Causality (start/end times)
- Essential semantic attributes

**Theorem 5 (Interoperability via Functors)**:  
If transformations between OTLP implementations are functorial (preserve composition and identities), then essential span properties are preserved across the entire pipeline.

*Proof*: Functors preserve structure by definition. If properties are defined as structural invariants, functoriality ensures they are maintained through composition.

**Practical Application**: When integrating multiple OTLP SDKs or backends, we verify that transformations (serialization, deserialization, format conversion) are functorial, ensuring that correctness properties are maintained end-to-end.

### 3.5 Temporal Logic Verification

Temporal logic allows us to specify and verify system-wide properties that hold over time. We use Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) for sequential properties and Computation Tree Logic (CTL) for branching-time properties.

#### 3.5.1 Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)

**LTL Syntax**:

```text
φ ::= p | ¬φ | φ1 ∧ φ2 | ○φ | φ1 U φ2 | □φ | ◊φ

where:
  p         = atomic proposition (e.g., "span s started")
  ¬φ        = negation
  φ1 ∧ φ2   = conjunction
  ○φ        = next (φ holds in the next state)
  φ1 U φ2   = until (φ1 holds until φ2 becomes true)
  □φ        = always (φ holds in all future states)
  ◊φ        = eventually (φ holds in some future state)
```

**LTL Properties for OTLP**:

1. **Span Completion**: If a span starts, it must eventually end.

   ```text
   □(started(s) → ◊ended(s))
   ```

2. **Error Logging**: If an error occurs, it must eventually be logged.

   ```text
   □(error(s) → ◊logged(s))
   ```

3. **Context Propagation**: If a service calls another, context is propagated before the call returns.

   ```text
   □(call(s1, s2) → (propagated(ctx) U returned(s1)))
   ```

4. **Causality**: A child span never starts before its parent.

   ```text
   □(started(child) → started(parent))
   ```

**Model Checking LTL Properties**:

We use a Büchi automaton to model check LTL properties. The algorithm:

```text
function ltl_model_check(trace: List[Span], φ: LTL) → Result[Unit, LTLViolation]:
  let automaton = build_buchi_automaton(φ)
  let states = trace_to_states(trace)
  
  for state in states:
    if not automaton.accepts(state):
      return Error(f"LTL violation: {φ} at state {state}")
  
  return Ok(())
```

**Example**: For our e-commerce trace, verify the "Span Completion" property:

```text
Property: □(started(s) → ◊ended(s))

Check each span:
  Span 1: started at T+0, ended at T+120   ✅
  Span 2: started at T+10, ended at T+110  ✅
  Span 3: started at T+20, ended at T+80   ✅
  Span 4: started at T+25, ended at T+75   ✅
  Span 5: started at T+85, ended at T+105  ✅
  Span 6: started at T+90, ended at T+95   ✅

All spans have end times → Property holds ✅
```

If Span 5 crashed and never exported an end time, the model checker would detect:

```text
Error: "LTL violation: □(started(s) → ◊ended(s)) - Span 005 started but never ended"
```

#### 3.5.2 Computation Tree Logic (CTL)

**CTL Syntax**:

```text
φ ::= p | ¬φ | φ1 ∧ φ2 | EXφ | EFφ | EGφ | E[φ1 U φ2] | AXφ | AFφ | AGφ | A[φ1 U φ2]

where:
  EXφ       = exists next (φ holds in some next state)
  EFφ       = exists eventually (φ holds in some future state on some path)
  EGφ       = exists globally (φ holds on all future states on some path)
  E[φ1 U φ2] = exists until
  AXφ       = for all next (φ holds in all next states)
  AFφ       = for all eventually (φ holds in all future states on all paths)
  AGφ       = for all globally (φ holds on all future states on all paths)
  A[φ1 U φ2] = for all until
```

**CTL Properties for OTLP**:

1. **Reachability**: From any span, there exists a path to the root span.

   ```text
   AG(∃ span s. EF(root(s)))
   ```

2. **No Deadlocks**: From any state, there is always a possible next state (trace can progress).

   ```text
   AG(EX(true))
   ```

3. **Error Recovery**: If an error occurs, there exists a path where it is handled.

   ```text
   AG(error(s) → EF(handled(s)))
   ```

4. **Invariants**: All spans always have valid trace IDs.

   ```text
   AG(valid_trace_id(s))
   ```

**Model Checking CTL Properties**:

```text
function ctl_model_check(trace: List[Span], φ: CTL) → Result[Unit, CTLViolation]:
  let state_graph = build_state_graph(trace)
  let labeling = label_states(state_graph)
  
  // Use fixed-point algorithm to evaluate CTL formula
  let satisfied_states = evaluate_ctl(state_graph, labeling, φ)
  
  if initial_state ∈ satisfied_states:
    return Ok(())
  else:
    return Error(f"CTL violation: {φ}")
```

**Example**: For the reachability property `AG(∃ s. EF(root(s)))`:

```text
Check each span can reach root (Span 1):
  Span 6 → Span 5 → Span 2 → Span 1  ✅
  Span 5 → Span 2 → Span 1           ✅
  Span 4 → Span 3 → Span 2 → Span 1 ✅
  Span 3 → Span 2 → Span 1           ✅
  Span 2 → Span 1                    ✅
  Span 1 (root)                      ✅

All spans can reach root → Property holds ✅
```

If Span 5 had a different Trace ID (context loss), creating a disconnected subgraph:

```text
Error: "CTL violation: AG(∃ s. EF(root(s))) - Span 005 cannot reach root"
```

**Theorem 6 (Temporal Property Verification)**:  
If a trace satisfies all specified LTL and CTL properties, then the system exhibits correct temporal behavior, including:

- All operations eventually complete
- Causality is preserved
- Error handling is correct
- All spans are reachable from the root

### 3.6 Integration and Workflow

The five components of our framework work together in a verification pipeline:

```text
OTLP Data Stream
       ↓
1. Type Checking
   - Structural validation
   - ID format checks
   - Timestamp validation
   ✓ Pass / ✗ Reject
       ↓
2. Semantic Validation
   - Attribute name/value checks
   - Convention compliance
   ✓ Pass / ⚠ Warning
       ↓
3. Triple Flow Analysis
   - Control flow (call graph)
   - Data flow (context propagation)
   - Execution flow (causality)
   ✓ Pass / ✗ Violation
       ↓
4. Algebraic Verification
   - Composition correctness
   - Aggregation consistency
   - Interoperability checks
   ✓ Pass / ⚠ Warning
       ↓
5. Temporal Logic Verification
   - LTL properties (sequential)
   - CTL properties (branching)
   ✓ Pass / ✗ Violation
       ↓
Verification Report
   - All checks passed ✅
   - Violations detected ❌
   - Warnings ⚠
   - Diagnostic information
```

**Incremental Verification**:

Our framework supports incremental verification, where partial traces are verified as they arrive:

```text
function incremental_verify(span: Span, state: VerificationState) → VerificationState:
  state' = state.add_span(span)
  
  // Type check new span
  if not typecheck_span(span, state'.store):
    state'.report_violation("Type error", span)
  
  // Update flow analysis
  state' = update_flow_analysis(state', span)
  
  // Check local temporal properties
  if not check_local_ltl(span, state'):
    state'.report_violation("LTL violation", span)
  
  return state'
```

This allows verification to happen in real-time, as spans are collected, rather than waiting for complete traces.

**Theorem 7 (Framework Soundness)**:  
If a trace passes all five verification components, then:

1. The trace is structurally well-formed (Type System)
2. Context is correctly propagated (Data Flow Analysis)
3. Causality is preserved (Execution Flow Analysis)
4. Composition and aggregation are consistent (Algebraic Structures)
5. All specified temporal properties hold (Temporal Logic)

*Proof*: By combining the soundness results of each component (Theorems 1-6).

**Theorem 8 (Framework Completeness)**:  
If a violation exists in any of the five aspects (structure, context, causality, composition, temporal properties), at least one verification component will detect it.

*Proof*: Each component is designed to cover a specific class of violations. The completeness follows from the comprehensive coverage of all aspects.
