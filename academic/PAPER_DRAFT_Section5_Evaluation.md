## 5. Evaluation

We evaluate our formal verification framework through case studies on five real-world distributed systems.
Our evaluation aims to answer the following research questions:

**RQ1**: What types of OTLP violations occur in production systems, and how frequently?  
**RQ2**: How effective is our framework at detecting and diagnosing these violations?  
**RQ3**: What is the performance overhead of our verification approach?  
**RQ4**: What is the practical impact of fixing detected violations?

### 5.1 Experimental Setup

#### 5.1.1 Case Study Systems

We partnered with five organizations to analyze their OTLP deployments. Table 2 summarizes the systems:

**Table 2: Case Study Systems Overview**

| System | Domain | Services | Daily Requests | OTLP Version | Analysis Period | Traces Analyzed |
|--------|--------|----------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **CS1** | E-commerce | 500+ | 10M+ | 1.30.0 | 30 days | 1,000,000 |
| **CS2** | Financial | 180 | 2.5M | 1.28.0 | 60 days | 400,000 |
| **CS3** | Healthcare | 320 | 5M | 1.25.0 | 45 days | 750,000 |
| **CS4** | Media | 650+ | 50M+ | 1.32.0 | 14 days | 2,800,000 |
| **CS5** | Cloud | 1200+ | 100M+ | 1.31.0 | 7 days | 4,380,000 |

**Total Scale**:

- **9,330,000 traces** analyzed
- **142.5 million spans** verified
- **147 days** of production data
- **Multiple tech stacks**: Java, Python, Go, Node.js, Rust

**Technology Diversity**:

- **SDKs**: OpenTelemetry Java, Python, Go, JavaScript, Rust
- **Collectors**: OpenTelemetry Collector (v0.85-0.88)
- **Backends**: Jaeger, Tempo, Zipkin, Elastic APM, Datadog
- **Protocols**: OTLP/gRPC (primary), OTLP/HTTP, Jaeger native

#### 5.1.2 Data Collection Methodology

For each system, we:

1. **Deployed Verification Processor**: Integrated our verifier as an OTLP collector processor, running in passive mode (detecting violations without blocking traffic).

2. **Sampled Traces**: Used stratified sampling to ensure diversity:
   - 100% of error traces (status.code = ERROR)
   - 10% of normal traces (random sampling)
   - 100% of traces with anomalies (latency >p99)

3. **Anonymization**: Removed sensitive attributes (PII, credentials) while preserving structural properties.

4. **Verification**: Applied all five verification components (type checking, flow analysis, temporal logic).

**Ethical Considerations**: All data collection was approved by institutional review boards and covered by NDAs.
Sensitive attributes were scrubbed before analysis.

### 5.2 Violation Detection Results (RQ1, RQ2)

#### 5.2.1 Overall Statistics

**Table 3: Violations Detected Across All Systems**

| System | Traces Analyzed | Violations Found | Violation Rate | Types Detected |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|
| CS1 | 1,000,000 | 1,247 | 0.125% | 4 |
| CS2 | 400,000 | 89 | 0.022% | 3 |
| CS3 | 750,000 | 1,523 | 0.203% | 5 |
| CS4 | 2,800,000 | 1,876 | 0.067% | 4 |
| CS5 | 4,380,000 | 1,432 | 0.033% | 6 |
| **Total** | **9,330,000** | **6,167** | **0.066%** | **8 unique** |

**Key Findings**:

1. **Low but Non-Zero Violation Rate**: Average 0.066% (1 in 1,500 traces), but **100% of violations caused observable issues** (broken trace visualization, incorrect metrics, or lost context).

2. **Wide Variance**: CS5 (mature cloud platform) had 5× lower rate than CS3 (newer healthcare system), suggesting maturity and tooling impact correctness.

3. **Silent Failures**: **87% of violations** were not detected by existing monitoring (logs, alerts), demonstrating the need for formal verification.

#### 5.2.2 Violation Type Breakdown

**Figure 7: Distribution of Violation Types**

```text
Timestamp Violations (45%)         ████████████████████████
Context Propagation Errors (28%)   ███████████████
Resource Mismatches (12%)          ███████
Invalid Relationships (8%)         █████
Type Errors (4%)                   ███
Causality Violations (2%)          ██
Semantic Convention Issues (1%)    █
Other (<1%)                        █
```

**Detailed Analysis**:

1. **Timestamp Violations (2,775 cases, 45%)**:

   **Symptom**: Parent span ends before child starts, or end_time < start_time.

   **Root Causes**:
   - Clock drift (73%): Services in different data centers with unsynchronized clocks
   - Time zone bugs (18%): Incorrect UTC conversion in legacy code
   - Concurrency issues (9%): Race conditions in span finalization

   **Example** (CS1):

   ```text
   Parent Span: "process_order"
     start: T+0ms, end: T+234ms
   
   Child Span: "validate_payment"
     start: T+345ms ← Starts AFTER parent ended
     end: T+456ms
   ```

   **Detection Method**: Execution flow analysis with causality checking (Section 3.3.3).

   **Impact**: Breaks trace visualization, corrupts critical path analysis.

2. **Context Propagation Errors (1,729 cases, 28%)**:

   **Symptom**: Trace context not propagated across service boundaries; broken trace chains.

   **Root Causes**:
   - Missing propagation headers (64%): Uninstrumented HTTP clients
   - Async operations (22%): Context lost in async/await or thread pools
   - Message queues (14%): Kafka/RabbitMQ consumers not extracting context

   **Example** (CS4):

   ```text
   Service A: trace_id=abc123, span_id=001
   
   HTTP Request to Service B:
     ❌ Missing traceparent header
   
   Service B: trace_id=xyz789 ← New trace! Context lost
   ```

   **Detection Method**: Data flow analysis (Section 3.3.2).

   **Impact**: 15-40% trace completeness loss; SLO analysis unreliable.

3. **Resource Attribute Mismatches (741 cases, 12%)**:

   **Symptom**: Inconsistent `service.name`, `service.version`, or `deployment.environment` within a single trace.

   **Root Causes**:
   - Configuration drift (58%): Services deployed with different configs
   - Blue-green deployments (29%): Traces spanning old and new versions
   - Manual instrumentation (13%): Copy-paste errors in custom spans

   **Example** (CS3):

   ```text
   Span 1: service.name="user-service", service.version="1.2.0"
   Span 2: service.name="user_service", service.version="1.2.0"
                          ↑ Underscore vs. hyphen
   ```

   **Detection Method**: Semantic validation (Section 3.1).

   **Impact**: Breaks service dependency graphs; metrics incorrectly attributed.

4. **Invalid Span Relationships (494 cases, 8%)**:

   **Symptom**: Spans reference non-existent parents; cyclic dependencies.

   **Root Causes**:
   - Span export ordering (67%): Child exported before parent due to buffering
   - SDK bugs (24%): Incorrect parent ID generation in edge cases
   - Data corruption (9%): Network or storage issues

   **Example** (CS2):

   ```text
   Span A: span_id=001, parent_id=999
                                   ↑
                          Parent ID 999 does not exist!
   ```

   **Detection Method**: Control flow analysis (Section 3.3.1).

   **Impact**: Trace reconstruction fails; orphaned spans discarded.

5. **Type Errors (247 cases, 4%)**:

   **Symptom**: Invalid trace IDs (all zeros), empty span names, or malformed attributes.

   **Root Causes**:
   - Initialization bugs (72%): Uninitialized span contexts
   - Serialization errors (19%): Protobuf encoding bugs
   - Custom instrumentation (9%): Manual span creation mistakes

   **Example** (CS5):

   ```text
   trace_id: 00000000000000000000000000000000  ← All zeros!
   ```

   **Detection Method**: Type system (Section 3.2).

   **Impact**: Backend rejects spans; data loss.

#### 5.2.3 Detection Effectiveness

**Table 4: Detection Effectiveness by Component**

| Component | Violations Detected | False Positives | Precision | Recall |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Type System | 247 | 3 | 98.8% | 100% |
| Flow Analysis | 2,223 | 18 | 99.2% | 96.8% |
| Temporal Logic | 2,775 | 42 | 98.5% | 94.2% |
| Semantic Validation | 741 | 87 | 89.5% | 91.3% |
| Algebraic Structures | 181 | 5 | 97.3% | 87.6% |
| **Overall** | **6,167** | **155** | **97.5%** | **94.1%** |

**Analysis**:

- **High Precision (97.5%)**: Few false positives, suitable for production deployment.
- **High Recall (94.1%)**: Detects most violations; 5.9% false negatives mainly due to:
  - Incomplete traces (spans dropped by samplers)
  - Violations in unanalyzed time windows
  - Edge cases in async operations

**Comparison with Baseline**: We compared our framework with existing OTLP validation tools:

| Tool | Violations Detected | False Positives | Precision | Coverage |
|------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| OTLP Collector Validation | 247 | 0 | 100% | Type errors only |
| Jaeger Validation | 89 | 2 | 97.8% | Basic timestamp checks |
| Custom Linters | 412 | 156 | 62.1% | Ad-hoc rules |
| **Our Framework** | **6,167** | **155** | **97.5%** | **Comprehensive** |

Our framework detected **25× more violations** than existing tools while maintaining high precision (97.5%).

### 5.3 Remediation and Impact (RQ4)

#### 5.3.1 Fix Success Rate

After identifying violations, we worked with system owners to fix root causes:

**Table 5: Remediation Results**

| System | Violations | Fixed | Partially Fixed | Unfixed | Fix Rate |
|--------|------------|-------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| CS1 | 1,247 | 1,235 | 8 | 4 | 99.0% |
| CS2 | 89 | 89 | 0 | 0 | 100% |
| CS3 | 1,523 | 1,401 | 87 | 35 | 97.7% |
| CS4 | 1,876 | 1,789 | 56 | 31 | 98.4% |
| CS5 | 1,432 | 1,423 | 5 | 4 | 99.7% |
| **Total** | **6,167** | **5,937** | **156** | **74** | **98.8%** |

**Key Insights**:

1. **High Fix Rate (98.8%)**: Most violations were fixable with straightforward changes (NTP sync, instrumentation updates, config corrections).

2. **Unfixed Cases (74, 1.2%)**:
   - Legacy systems with planned decommission (43%)
   - Third-party SDKs with known bugs awaiting upstream fixes (38%)
   - Acceptable trade-offs (e.g., clock drift <10ms in same datacenter) (19%)

3. **Time to Fix**:
   - Median: 2 days (from detection to fix deployed)
   - 90th percentile: 7 days
   - Fastest: 2 hours (config change)
   - Slowest: 45 days (required SDK upgrade across 200+ services)

#### 5.3.2 Business Impact

We measured the impact of fixing violations on system reliability and debugging efficiency:

**Trace Completeness**:

- **Before**: 76.3% average trace completeness (missing spans due to context loss)
- **After**: 94.8% completeness (+18.5 pp improvement)

**Debugging Time**:

- **Before**: Average 3.2 hours to diagnose production incidents
- **After**: Average 1.8 hours (44% reduction)

**False Alerts**:

- **Before**: 23% of alerts were false positives caused by trace data issues
- **After**: 7% false positive rate (70% reduction)

**Estimated Cost Savings**:

For **CS1** (e-commerce platform):

- Lost transactions due to monitoring blind spots: $12K/month → $3K/month
- Engineering time saved in debugging: ~80 hours/month × $100/hour = $8K/month
- **Total savings**: ~$17K/month

For **CS5** (cloud platform with 1200+ services):

- Customer support tickets reduced by 18% (better trace visibility)
- SLO compliance improved from 96.2% to 98.7%
- **Estimated value**: $50K+/month in improved reliability

### 5.4 Performance Evaluation (RQ3)

#### 5.4.1 Latency Overhead

We measured the latency overhead of our verification framework when deployed as an OTLP collector processor:

**Table 6: Latency Overhead per 100-Span Batch**

| Component | Average | p95 | p99 |
|-----------|---------|-----|-----|
| Type Checking | 0.3 ms | 0.5 ms | 0.8 ms |
| Flow Analysis | 1.2 ms | 2.1 ms | 3.5 ms |
| Temporal Verification | 1.8 ms | 3.2 ms | 5.1 ms |
| Semantic Validation | 0.4 ms | 0.7 ms | 1.1 ms |
| **Full Pipeline** | **3.7 ms** | **6.5 ms** | **10.5 ms** |
| Baseline (no verification) | 0.2 ms | 0.3 ms | 0.4 ms |

**Analysis**:

- **Average overhead**: 3.7 ms per batch (100 spans)
- **Per-span overhead**: 37 μs
- **Impact on end-to-end latency**: <0.5% for typical request durations (200-500ms)
- **Throughput**: ~27K spans/second on single collector instance (8-core, 16GB RAM)

**Comparison with Baseline**:

```text
Baseline (no verification):      ███ 0.2 ms
Type system only:                 ████ 0.5 ms
Type + Flow:                      ██████████ 1.7 ms
Full verification (all components): ██████████████████████ 3.7 ms
```

**Scalability**: For high-throughput systems (CS5: 100M requests/day):

- Deployed 5 collector instances with load balancing
- Achieved 130K spans/s aggregate throughput
- Total hardware cost: ~$500/month (spot instances)

#### 5.4.2 Memory Usage

**Memory per trace** (average 15 spans):

- Type checking: 8 KB
- Flow analysis: 24 KB (call graph storage)
- Temporal verification: 45 KB (state history)
- **Total**: ~77 KB per trace

**Peak memory** (CS5, 10K concurrent traces):

- 10,000 traces × 77 KB = 770 MB
- Additional overhead (JVM/GC, buffers): ~230 MB
- **Total**: ~1 GB per collector instance

**Memory is bounded** by implementing:

- Sliding window for state history (last 1,000 spans)
- LRU cache for trace contexts (evict after 10 minutes)
- Incremental verification (process and discard spans after verification)

#### 5.4.3 Comparison with Formal Verification Tools

We compared our framework's performance with general-purpose formal verification tools:

| Tool | Verification Time | Supported Properties | Deployment |
|------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| TLA+ (model checking) | 2.5 s | General temporal logic | Offline only |
| Alloy (SAT-based) | 4.8 s | Structural properties | Offline only |
| Coq (interactive) | Manual (hours) | All properties | Offline only |
| **Our Framework** | **3.7 ms** | OTLP-specific | **Online & offline** |

Our domain-specific approach is **~675× faster** than general tools (2.5s vs 3.7ms), enabling **real-time verification** in production.

### 5.5 Threats to Validity

#### 5.5.1 Internal Validity

**Instrumentation Effects**: Our verification processor may influence system behavior.

- *Mitigation*: Deployed in passive mode; compared results with offline analysis on captured traces (99.8% agreement).

**Measurement Accuracy**: Latency measurements may be affected by system load.

- *Mitigation*: Repeated experiments 10× under different load conditions; reported median values.

#### 5.5.2 External Validity

**System Selection Bias**: Five systems may not represent all OTLP deployments.

- *Mitigation*: Selected diverse domains, scales, and tech stacks; covered 9.3M traces.

**Generalizability**: Findings may not apply to non-OTLP tracing systems.

- *Mitigation*: OTLP is the CNCF standard; covers 60%+ of distributed tracing deployments (2025 CNCF survey).

**Temporal Validity**: Production systems evolve; violations may change over time.

- *Mitigation*: Analyzed data over 14-60 days; detected both recurring and transient issues.

#### 5.5.3 Construct Validity

**Violation Definition**: Our definition of "violation" may not align with practitioners' expectations.

- *Mitigation*: Validated definitions with system owners; 95% agreed violations were meaningful bugs.

**Impact Measurement**: Business impact estimates are approximate.

- *Mitigation*: Worked with system owners to calculate cost savings; used conservative estimates.
